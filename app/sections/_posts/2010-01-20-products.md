<p class="left">Picoyune has adapted our cutting edge plasmonic mercury sensor for applications in vapor, liquid, and solid sample analysis. The Runabout, our portable vapor analyzer, is a sensitive tool for the most demanding field measurements. It is the ideal tool for immediate results in the presence of other contaminants.</p>

<p class="left">Picoyune offers a thermal sample decomposition system that pairs with the Runabout for liquid and solid samples. Deploy quickly and get results immediately with this uniquely portable analyzer. The entire system is battery operable and requires no compressed gasses or consumables.</p>

<p class="left">Our sensors require a high intensity light source of surpassing stability, tuned to the active bandwidth of our plasmonic film.  By combining a high accuracy temperature sensor, and resistive heaters directly on the LED board, we were able to achieve the performance we required in a compact package.</p>

<p class="left">Weâ€™re offering this innovative light source as a stand-alone package in a wide variety of narrow and broad band colors.  View the <a href="/leroy.html">LeRoy product page</a> for more information.</p>
